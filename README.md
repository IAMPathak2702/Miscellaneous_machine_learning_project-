# Miscellaneous Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the "Miscellaneous Machine Learning Projects" repository! This collection encompasses a variety of hands-on projects spanning diverse domains within machine learning. Each project explores different datasets, algorithms, and applications to provide a broad understanding of machine learning concepts.

# Project Highlights:

# 1.# Blood Cell Image Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify different types of blood cells based on microscopic images. The classifier can be used for medical diagnosis, research, and educational purposes.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of microscopic images of various types of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and platelets.

## Model Architecture
We utilized convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures such as ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet. Transfer learning techniques were applied to adapt pre-trained models to the specific task of blood cell classification.

## Training
The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets. The model was trained on the training data, optimizing the cross-entropy loss function using the Adam optimizer. Training progress was monitored using metrics like accuracy, loss, and validation accuracy.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model was assessed on the validation set to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The final model was evaluated on the testing set to measure its generalization ability. Confusion matrices and classification reports were analyzed to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.

# 2. # SkimLit
